# ECE 250- Data Structures and Algorithms Project 4 | Minimum Spanning Tree
* This program implements a Minimum Spanning Tree; some main requirements of this project include: 
  * Inserting an edge into the weighted undirected graph
  * Implementing Prim's Algorithm 
  * Returning the degree of a specific vertex and the weight of the connecting vertices
* This project solidified my understanding of Prim's algorithm
