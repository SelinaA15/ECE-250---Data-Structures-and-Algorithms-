#ECE 250- Data Structures and Algorithms Project 1 | Dynamic Stack : 
This program implements a dynamic stack using an array, the requirements of this project included implementing functions such push, pop and clear to manipulate objects on the stack.
This project further extended my understanding of the functions and limitations of a stack data structure.
