# ECE 250- Data Structures and Algorithms Project 2 | Double Hash Table  
* This program implements a double hash table; the requirements of this project include: 
  * Inserting and removing values
  * Handling collisions using double hashing
  * Checking for the size of the hash table, the capacity and an empty flag
* This project further extended my understanding of the double hashing algorithm and how data is stored in a hash table
