# ECE 250- Data Structures and Algorithms Project 3 | Trie Data Structure 
* This program implements a trie tree data structure; some main requirements of this project include: 
  * Inserting and removing a word from the tree
  * Clearing all trees and sub-trees 
  * Returning a flag if a node is the terminal node of a word
  * Returning a flag if a string is represented in the tree
* This project deepened my knowledge of the tree data structure as it allowed me to apply
fundamental concepts learned in class to a more complex tree model
